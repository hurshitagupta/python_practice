# Mini Projects using NumPy

This folder contains beginner-friendly mini projects built using NumPy. Each project focuses on applying different NumPy concepts in fun and practical ways.

## Projects

### ðŸŽ² Dice Roll Simulator
Simulates rolling two dice multiple times and analyzes the frequency of the sums.

Built using:
- **Core Python** (for logic building and flow control)
- **NumPy** (for efficient array operations and randomness)

Concepts practiced:
- Random number generation
- Loops and conditionals
- Dictionary usage
- NumPy arrays
- Unique value counting

### ðŸ“Š Grade Analytics Tool 
A project to calculate average grades, analyze student performance, and find top performers using NumPy operations.

Built using:
- **NumPy** (for statistical calculations and array manipulation)

Concepts practiced:
- NumPy array creation
- Mean, min, max functions
- Conditional filtering
- Basic statistics with NumPy
