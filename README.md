# Python Practice Repository

## Welcome!
This repository contains my ongoing Python practice work. I’ve structured it into folders based on topics and difficulty levels. The aim is to build a strong foundation in Python programming through practical coding exercises.

```

Each file is a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) with hands-on examples, short notes, and small challenges.
