# ðŸ§¾ Inventory Report Generator (Pandas Mini Project)

This is a beginner-friendly mini project I built to practice real-life data analysis using **Pandas**.  
The project focuses on working with a small inventory dataset and applying core Pandas skills like cleaning, grouping, and generating insights.

---

## What I Practiced

- ðŸ“‹ Creating a DataFrame
- ðŸ§¼ Data Cleaning (sorting, resetting index, formatting)
- ðŸ§® Creating new columns (like Total Revenue)
- ðŸ“Š Grouping data using `.groupby()`
- ðŸ“Œ Filtering top/low-performing items
- ðŸ§  Replacing values in a column

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights Generated

- Inventory summary for each product
- Revenue and quantity analysis by category
- Top 3 products by revenue
- Low-performing products by quantity
- Replaced category name `"Audio"` with `"Sound Gear"`
- Calculated average revenue per category

## Why This Project?

This was my **first mini project using Pandas**, and it helped me understand how real data is cleaned, organized, and analyzed.  
It made me realize that just reading or watching tutorials isn't enoughâ€”you need to **build things** to really get it. This was one of those "ohhh now I get it!" moments.

## Files

- `inventory_report_generator.py`: The complete Python script  
(No external file needed â€” data is created directly inside the code)

## What's Next?

I'll keep building more mini projects as I learn new Pandas conceptsâ€”this is just the start ðŸš€
