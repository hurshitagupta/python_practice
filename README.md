# Python Practice Repository

## Welcome!
This repository contains my ongoing Python practice work. I’ve structured it into folders based on topics and difficulty levels. The aim is to build a strong foundation in Python programming through practical coding exercises.

## Folder Structure

```

│
├── 03_control_flow/
│   ├── conditional_statements.ipynb  # Covers if, if-else, if-elif-else + practice
│
└── README.md
```

Each file is a Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) with hands-on examples, short notes, and small challenges.

## 📌 Topics Covered So Far

- Variables & Data Types  
- Operators (Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical)  
- Special Practice Questions (string, digit, swapping)  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `if-else`, `if-elif-else`)

🔜 Coming Up:
- Loops (for / while)  
- More control flow patterns  
- Strings, Lists, Tuples  
- Dictionaries & Sets  
- User Defined Functions
- OOP Basics

## How to Run the Code

You can open these `.ipynb` files using:

- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda / VS Code / Jupyter Lab)
